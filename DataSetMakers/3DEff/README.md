* Codes for efficiency for each y, pT, cent bins
* ./drawing.sh compiles and runs jobs with options
* binArrays.h, binArrays3D.h: Define y, pT, cent arrays, have to be put under a given y-pT directory.
* All other files need to be linked to a given y-pT directory
* Then ./drawing.sh visits all sub-directories and fill up efficiency histograms
